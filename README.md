This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to recognize handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset. 
The application includes training, evaluating, and predicting digits, with utilities to save and load models for future use.

Instructions:
  1. Install dependencies
  2. Run data_loader.py
  3. Run train.py
  4. Use predict.py and evaluate.py to check your model.
